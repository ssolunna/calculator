# Calculator

Interesting to know how a basic calculator works from inside. Trying to build one was a rollercoaster of bugs, so if you find any let me know.

This project was made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)'s curriculum. ([Live Preview](https://ssolunna.github.io/calculator/))
